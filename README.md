## 📌 Project Overview

This project is not just a delivery time predictor.

It is an **AI-powered Operational Decision Support System** designed to:

* Predict food delivery ETA
* Estimate delay risk
* Simulate real-world conditions (traffic, peak hour, weather)
* Provide actionable recommendations

The goal is to improve delivery efficiency and reduce late orders through data-driven insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Food delivery platforms struggle with:

* Inaccurate ETA predictions
* Late deliveries
* Poor rider allocation
* Customer dissatisfaction

Even small ETA errors can significantly impact:

* Customer trust
* Order cancellation rate
* Platform ratings
* Operational cost

This system helps solve that by predicting ETA and identifying operational risk in advance.

---

## 🧠 System Capabilities

### 1️⃣ ETA Prediction

Predicts delivery time based on:

* Delivery partner age
* Delivery partner rating
* Distance between restaurant and customer
* Order type
* Vehicle type

---

### 2️⃣ Risk Analysis Engine

Classifies delivery into:

* ✅ Low Delay Risk
* ⚠ Moderate Delay Risk
* 🚦 High Delay Risk

Provides a risk score percentage to support operational decisions.

---

### 3️⃣ Real-World Simulation Layer

The system includes simulated operational factors such as:

* Peak hour multiplier
* Traffic congestion level
* Weather impact

This demonstrates how external factors affect delivery time.

---

### 4️⃣ Decision Recommendation Engine

Instead of only predicting time, the system provides:

* Reassignment suggestions
* Surge incentive suggestion
* Risk alerts for long-distance orders
* Operational flagging for low-rated riders

This moves the project from prediction to business intelligence.

---

## 🔬 Machine Learning Approach

### Data Processing

* Cleaned unrealistic age and rating values
* Calculated distance using Haversine formula
* Encoded categorical variables
* Feature engineering (distance bucket, experience score)

### Models Tested

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting

### Optimization 

* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
* Cross-validation for stability

### Final Model

Gradient Boosting Regressor selected based on:

* Lowest MAE
* Stable R² score
* Balanced bias-variance performance

---

## 📊 Model Performance

(Replace with your actual numbers)

* MAE: ~3–5 minutes
* RMSE: Stable across folds
* R² Score: 0.70+
* Cross-validation MAE: Consistent
